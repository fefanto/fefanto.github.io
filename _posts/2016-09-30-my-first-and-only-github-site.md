The purpose of this site is : 

* a brief description of myself 
* a list of my projects on github, as well as external projects.
* (this takes 99% of the purpose of this site) getting better at html5/css/js/angular/git...you get it.

Credits for the superbasic superdraft version of this site : 

* [Github pages home](https://pages.github.com/)
* Step by step guite to setup a github personal page and jekyll blog from [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
